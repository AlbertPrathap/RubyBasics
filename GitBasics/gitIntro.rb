Git:
*Used to track changes in your code.
*Helps you save different versions of your code.
*Works offline, on your own computer.
*You can go back to an earlier version if something breaks.

GitHub:
*A website to store your Git code online.
*Lets you share your code with others.
*Great for working with teams.
*Also useful for backing up your projects.

In short:
*Git = Tracks changes and saves versions (on your computer).
*GitHub = Stores those versions online so others can see, use, or contribute.

Git Commands:

1) git config --global user.name "Albert"

This tells Git:
“Use the name ‘Albert’ when I make a commit.”

2) git config --global user.email "prathape08@gmail.com"

This tells Git:
“Use this email ‘prathape08@gmail.com’ when I make a commit.”

Why it matters:
*When you make changes to code and save them in Git (called a commit), Git needs to know who made those changes.
*These commands help Git attach your name and email to each commit — like a signature.

What does --global mean?
It means:
*“Apply this setting for all my Git projects on this computer.”
*So you don’t need to set your name and email every time you create a new project.
